#################FIXED BUGS ###########################################

#PROBLEM# calls get saved to the db multiple times
	#SOURCE# This is caused by the web requests being slow, then the second or third web request catching up and saving all of them, I decide which calls to 
				   save before the web request is sent, let alone finished
	#RESOLUTION# In the ActiveCall model, validate unique sid resolved the issue of duplication, added sid as a index in the db that only saves unique values
				 due to the sql race limitation of uniqueness validation


#PROBLEM# if the calls are already active when the pageloads, @new_calls is empty?!?!?!?

	#SOURCE#  when a user reloaded the page, the hidden sid list wasn't correctly blamke out
	the hidden field generates the initial sid correctly and changes based on new calls
	#RESOLUTION# jquery on page load to reset the hidden sid list to "", forcing all the new calls to be drawn
